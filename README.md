# ipamtools
This was developed as a simple way to populate our netbox instance with data from vSphere.

It contains some functions that use the pyvmomi module and will pull objects from vCenters and populate them in netbox.

Right now its literally just a skeleton and only populating clusters. Will break it out into modules etc.
