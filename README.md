This was developed as a simple way to populate our netbox instance with data from vSphere.

It contains some functions that use the pyvmomi module and will pull objects from vCenters and populate them in netbox.

Right now its just populating clusters. Also your expected to know the type, site id's. If I did a UI I would map them to menu items etc.
